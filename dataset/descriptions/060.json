  "context": "You’re looking at a forward-facing dash-cam view from a car currently on a highway exit ramp leading off a busy multi-lane freeway.",
  "goal": "Safely exit the freeway using exit 2B.",
  "perception": "The vehicle is on the right-side exit ramp marked as Exit 2B with a speed advisory sign of 30 mph. The main freeway to the left is congested with multiple lanes of slow-moving traffic including cars and trucks. The exit ramp is clear ahead with one black SUV visible in front. The ramp curves gently to the right and is separated from the main freeway by a painted gore area and a concrete barrier on the right. There are no pedestrians or cyclists visible. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "prediction": "The black SUV ahead will continue to slow down to comply with the exit speed limit and follow the ramp curve. Traffic on the main freeway will remain slow and congested.",
  "planning": "Maintain a safe following distance behind the black SUV, reduce speed to comply with the 30 mph advisory, and stay within the exit lane to safely complete the freeway exit.",
