  "context": "You’re looking at a forward-facing dash-cam view from a car driving on a two-lane urban street at night with parked cars on both sides.",
  "goal": "Continue driving straight through the intersection.",
  "perception": "The road is marked with double yellow lines indicating no passing. The word 'SCHOOL' is painted on the road, indicating a school zone. The traffic light ahead is green, allowing vehicles to proceed. There is an oncoming vehicle in the opposite lane with its headlights on. Parked cars line both sides of the street. The street is dimly lit with streetlights, and visibility is moderate due to nighttime conditions. No pedestrians are visible on or near the crosswalks.",
  "prediction": "The oncoming vehicle will continue driving straight in its lane. The green light will likely remain for a few more seconds, allowing traffic to proceed through the intersection.",
  "planning": "Maintain current speed and lane, proceed straight through the intersection while remaining alert for any pedestrians or vehicles entering from the sides, especially given the school zone. Be prepared to slow down if the light changes or if any hazards appear.",
