  "perception": "The vehicle is traveling on a two-lane street with one lane in each direction. There is a marked bike lane on the right side of the road, separated by a solid white line. Parked cars line the right side of the street beyond the bike lane. A yellow diamond-shaped sign indicates a speed bump ahead with a recommended speed of 15 mph. The road surface appears clear and dry. There is a traffic light visible in the distance, currently green. No pedestrians or cyclists are immediately visible in the lane or crossing the street. The weather is clear with good visibility.",
