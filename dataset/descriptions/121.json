  "goal": "Proceed straight through the intersection.",
  "perception": "The traffic light ahead is green, allowing vehicles to proceed straight. There are two vehicles ahead in the lane, a white car and a black SUV. Pedestrians are waiting at the crosswalk on the right side, not currently crossing. The street ahead is narrow with parked cars on both sides. A no left turn sign is visible on the right side, indicating left turns are prohibited at this intersection. The road markings show a straight lane with crosswalks clearly marked. Weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "prediction": "The vehicles ahead will continue moving straight through the intersection. Pedestrians will likely wait until the light changes before crossing.",
  "planning": "Proceed straight through the intersection following the green light, maintaining a safe distance from the vehicles ahead and yielding to any pedestrians who may begin crossing.",
