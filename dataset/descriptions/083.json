  "context": "You’re looking at a forward-facing dash-cam view from a car driving on a two-lane urban street in a residential area with snow piled on the sides.",
  "goal": "Continue driving straight ahead.",
  "perception": "The road is a two-lane street with one lane in each direction, separated by a dashed white line. Snow is piled along both sides of the street, narrowing the drivable area. Parked cars line both sides of the street. There are pedestrians on the right sidewalk, one walking away from the camera and another further ahead near the intersection. The traffic light ahead is green, allowing vehicles to proceed straight. The weather is cold and overcast, with some snow on the car hood and road edges. Visibility is good despite the winter conditions.",
  "prediction": "The vehicle ahead will continue moving forward through the green light. Pedestrians on the right sidewalk may approach the crosswalk but are not currently crossing. The green light is likely to remain for a few more seconds.",
  "planning": "Maintain current speed and lane, proceed straight through the intersection while monitoring the vehicle ahead and pedestrians near the sidewalk. Be prepared to slow down if pedestrians enter the crosswalk or if the traffic light changes.",
