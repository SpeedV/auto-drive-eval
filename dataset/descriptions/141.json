{
  "context": "The dashcam shows a view of an urban street intersection with a crosswalk and a pedestrian signal on the right side.",
  "goal": "Proceed straight through the intersection.",
  "perception": "The intersection is in a city area with multi-story buildings and a closed restaurant on the corner. The pedestrian signal on the right shows a white walking figure, indicating pedestrians have the right of way to cross. The traffic light for vehicles is not visible, but the presence of the pedestrian walk signal suggests the vehicle may need to yield. The crosswalk markings are clear, and the street appears to be two-way with no visible lane markings in the immediate view. There is a vehicle with headlights on approaching from the right side, possibly turning or crossing the intersection.",
  "prediction": "Pedestrians will likely continue crossing the street as indicated by the walk signal. The vehicle on the right may proceed through or turn, potentially crossing the ego vehicle's path.",
  "planning": "Yield to pedestrians currently crossing and prepare to stop if necessary. Proceed with caution through the intersection once the pedestrian crossing is clear and it is safe to do so.",
