  "context": "You’re looking at a forward-facing dash-cam view from a car driving on a narrow, two-way residential street with parked cars lining both sides.",
  "goal": "Continue driving straight ahead on this residential street.",
  "perception": "The street is a two-way road with vehicles parked on both sides, reducing the effective driving width. The road surface is clear and dry, and visibility is good under clear daylight. There are no visible traffic signs or signals in the immediate view. The left side has brick residential buildings, while the right side has a fenced area with trees and a sports court or playground. There are no pedestrians or moving vehicles immediately ahead or crossing the street. The street appears calm with no immediate hazards.",
  "prediction": "The vehicle can continue moving forward safely, but must be cautious of potential vehicles emerging from between parked cars or pedestrians near the sidewalk.",
  "planning": "Proceed forward at a moderate speed, staying centered in the lane to avoid parked cars on both sides, and remain alert for any sudden obstacles or crossing pedestrians.",
