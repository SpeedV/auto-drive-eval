  "context": "The dash-cam shows a nighttime urban intersection with a green traffic light visible on the left side.",
  "goal": "Proceed straight through the intersection safely.",
  "perception": "The traffic light is green, indicating the ego vehicle has the right of way to proceed straight. There is a pedestrian crossing the street from right to left in front of the vehicle, and a cyclist is approaching the intersection from the left side. Oncoming vehicles with headlights on are visible further down the road. The street is dimly lit, and visibility is limited due to darkness.",
  "prediction": "The pedestrian will continue crossing the street, potentially slowing the vehicle's progress. The cyclist may enter the intersection shortly. Oncoming traffic will continue straight on their lane.",
  "planning": "Yield to the pedestrian currently crossing the street despite the green light, slowing or stopping as necessary to ensure their safety. Remain alert for the cyclist entering the intersection. Proceed only when the crosswalk is clear and it is safe to do so.",
