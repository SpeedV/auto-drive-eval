  "context": "You’re looking at a forward-facing dash-cam view from a car driving at night on a multi-lane road approaching an intersection with traffic lights.",
  "goal": "Proceed straight through the intersection.",
  "perception": "The road is divided into multiple lanes with clear lane markings. The ego vehicle is in the leftmost lane of the main road. Ahead, a blue van is traveling in the same lane. The traffic light visible ahead is green, indicating permission to proceed. There is a right-turn-only lane separated by dashed lines on the right side. The road is well-lit with streetlights, and there are no pedestrians visible on or near the roadway. Traffic appears moderate with vehicles visible further ahead. The weather conditions are clear.",
  "prediction": "The blue van ahead will continue straight through the intersection as the light remains green. Traffic in other lanes will also proceed forward or turn right as indicated by lane markings and signals.",
  "planning": "Maintain current lane and speed to proceed straight through the intersection while keeping a safe following distance behind the blue van. Be prepared to adjust speed if traffic ahead slows or if the traffic light changes.",
