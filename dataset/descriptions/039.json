  "context": "You’re looking at a forward-facing dash-cam view from a car driving on a multi-lane urban street in a city with tall buildings on both sides.",
  "goal": "Continue driving straight ahead.",
  "perception": "The road has three lanes in the direction of travel. The left lane is marked with blue lines, likely indicating a bus or emergency vehicle lane. A red FDNY van is traveling in the left lane. The middle lane is clear and open for general traffic. The right lane is occupied by a large city bus. Parked vehicles line the right side of the street. Traffic signals ahead are green, allowing vehicles to proceed. There are no pedestrians crossing the street at this moment. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "prediction": "Traffic in all lanes will continue moving forward as the green light remains active. The FDNY van may maintain its speed in the left lane, and the bus will continue in the right lane.",
  "planning": "Maintain the current lane (middle lane) and proceed straight through the intersection, keeping a safe distance from the FDNY van on the left and the bus on the right. Prepare to adjust speed if traffic ahead slows.",
