  "context": "The image shows a forward-facing dash-cam view of a dimly lit urban street at night with sparse traffic.",
  "goal": "Continue driving straight ahead.",
  "perception": "The road is a multi-lane urban street with at least two lanes visible in the direction of travel. There is a vehicle ahead in the same lane, moving forward. Streetlights and some illuminated signs are present, but overall visibility is low due to nighttime conditions. There are no visible traffic signals or stop signs in the immediate view. The right side of the road has a sidewalk and some buildings, including a gas station. The left side is darker with fewer visible details. No pedestrians or cyclists are visible on or near the roadway.",
  "prediction": "The vehicle ahead will continue moving forward along the lane. No immediate obstacles or changes in traffic control are visible, so traffic flow is expected to remain steady in the next few seconds.",
  "planning": "Maintain current speed and lane position, keeping a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead. Stay alert for any changes in traffic signals or unexpected obstacles given the low visibility conditions.",
