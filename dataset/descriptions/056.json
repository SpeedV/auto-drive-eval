There is a school bus parked on the left side, and several other cars parked along the curb. The road surface appears clear with no visible pedestrians or immediate hazards. Streetlights provide limited illumination. The vehicle ahead is moving forward at a moderate speed. No traffic signals or stop signs are visible in the immediate vicinity.",
