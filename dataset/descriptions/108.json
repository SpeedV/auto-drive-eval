  "context": "You’re looking at a forward-facing dash-cam view from a car driving on a multi-lane road at night approaching a bridge with illuminated arches.",
  "goal": "Continue driving straight ahead across the bridge.",
  "perception": "The road is well-lit with streetlights and lane markings visible. There are two lanes in the direction of travel, separated by dashed white lines. Green traffic lights are visible ahead, indicating permission to proceed. Road signs on both sides indicate lane directions: the left lane can go straight or turn left, and the right lane is for going straight only. The bridge ahead is illuminated with colored lights, and there are no pedestrians or obstacles visible on the road. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "prediction": "Vehicles will continue moving forward across the bridge as the traffic light remains green. No immediate hazards or changes in traffic flow are expected in the next few seconds.",
  "planning": "Maintain current lane and speed to proceed straight across the bridge, following the green traffic signal and lane markings. Stay alert for any changes in traffic lights or unexpected obstacles.",
