  "context": "You’re looking at a forward-facing dash-cam view from a car stopped behind a parked vehicle on a dimly lit urban street at night.",
  "goal": "Proceed forward along the street.",
  "perception": "The street is a two-lane road with one lane in each direction, marked by double yellow lines in the center. The vehicle ahead is parked partially on the street and partially on the curb, with its rear lights off. There is a red traffic light visible further down the road, indicating a stop signal for vehicles traveling in this direction. Streetlights illuminate the sidewalk and parked cars along both sides of the street. No pedestrians are visible on the road or sidewalks. The weather is clear, and visibility is adequate despite the nighttime conditions.",
  "prediction": "The traffic light ahead will remain red for a short period, requiring vehicles to stop. The parked car ahead will remain stationary. Other vehicles behind or approaching the intersection may also stop.",
  "planning": "Remain stopped behind the parked vehicle and prepare to stop fully at the red traffic light ahead. Do not attempt to pass the parked car due to the narrow lane and oncoming traffic lane. Wait for the light to turn green before proceeding.",
