  "context": "You’re looking at a forward-facing dash-cam view from a car driving on a two-lane highway with a solid double yellow line in the center and a guardrail on the right side. There is an overpass ahead under a clear blue sky.",
  "goal": "Continue driving straight on the highway.",
  "perception": "The road has two lanes separated by a solid double yellow line, indicating no passing or lane changes across the center. Traffic is moderate, with several vehicles ahead in the left lane moving slowly or stopped, and a few vehicles in the opposite lane. The right lane is clear but bounded by a guardrail. There is a speed limit sign visible on the right side indicating a limit of 39 (units unknown). The overpass ahead does not appear to restrict the lane or visibility. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "prediction": "Traffic ahead in the left lane will continue moving slowly or remain stopped for the next few seconds. Vehicles in the opposite lane will continue moving in the opposite direction. No immediate lane changes are possible due to the solid double yellow line.",
  "planning": "Maintain current lane and speed, keeping a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead. Do not attempt to overtake or change lanes due to the solid double yellow line and traffic conditions. Prepare to slow down if traffic ahead remains stopped.",
