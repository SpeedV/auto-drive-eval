  "context": "You’re looking at a forward-facing dash-cam view from a car stopped at a traffic light on a multi-lane road in an urban area.",
  "goal": "Proceed straight through the intersection when the light turns green.",
  "perception": "The vehicle is stopped behind a black Nissan Pathfinder at a red traffic light. To the left, there is a black pickup truck also stopped. A large white truck is making a left turn across the intersection. The traffic light ahead is red. Road signs indicate a truck route and local traffic directions, with trucks directed to turn left or right and passenger vehicles allowed to go straight or turn. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "prediction": "The white truck will complete its left turn across the intersection. The traffic light will soon change from red to green, allowing vehicles to proceed straight or turn as permitted.",
  "planning": "Remain stopped behind the black Nissan Pathfinder until the traffic light turns green. Once green, proceed straight through the intersection, ensuring the left-turning truck has cleared the path and the intersection is safe.",
