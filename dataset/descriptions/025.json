The weather is clear with good visibility.",
  "prediction": "Vehicles in the left-turn lane will begin turning left, and vehicles in the straight lanes will proceed forward through the intersection.",
  "planning": "Proceed straight through the intersection, maintaining lane and speed consistent with the green light, while being cautious of vehicles turning left from the adjacent lane.",
