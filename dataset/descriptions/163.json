  "context": "You’re looking at a forward-facing dash-cam view from a car stopped at a dark residential intersection at night.",
  "goal": "Proceed straight through the intersection.",
  "perception": "The vehicle is stopped at an intersection with a cross street visible ahead. The road is dimly lit with some streetlights and building lights on the left side. Parked cars line both sides of the street ahead. There are no visible traffic signals or stop signs in the image, but the vehicle appears to be stopped, implying a stop sign or right-of-way rule may apply. The road surface shows some markings but they are not clearly visible due to darkness. No pedestrians or moving vehicles are visible in the immediate intersection area.",
  "prediction": "The intersection is likely clear of cross traffic and pedestrians at this moment, so it is safe to proceed cautiously.",
  "planning": "Proceed straight through the intersection with caution, ensuring to check for any cross traffic or pedestrians before moving forward due to limited visibility and potential stop sign or right-of-way rules.",
