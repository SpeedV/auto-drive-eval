There are no visible traffic signals or signs in the immediate vicinity. On the right side, there is a car dealership with parked vehicles and illuminated signage. On the left side, there is a median separating the opposite traffic lanes. There are no pedestrians or obstacles visible on the road. Oncoming traffic headlights are visible far ahead.",
