  "context": "Nighttime forward-facing dash-cam view at an intersection with a green traffic light and a sign indicating a right exit to Coney Island Ave.",
  "goal": "Proceed straight through the intersection.",
  "perception": "The vehicle is stopped or moving slowly at a multi-lane intersection at night. The traffic light ahead is green, allowing movement through the intersection. Road markings indicate a lane for turning right and lanes for going straight. There is a sign overhead indicating that the right lane leads to Coney Island Ave. The road surface is worn with some debris, and visibility is limited due to darkness. No pedestrians or cyclists are visible in the immediate vicinity.",
